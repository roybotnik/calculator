This is a calculator. The UI is written in angular. The backend is written in python and uses flask.

For some reason this calculator makes API requests to perform calculations.

---

It is assumed that you have python and pip (and probably virtualenv) already installed.

To install required dependencies, run the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start the app:
```
python calc.py
```

To run tests for the service:
```
python calc_tests.py
```

Look at the README in the ui_test directory to see how to run the UI tests.
