*Note: This readme concerns the UI components only.*

The JavaScript UI components in this folder have a test suite which can be run via [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), and [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html).

---

All of the following commands should be run from within the ui directory.

To install required dependencies, run the following:
```
npm install
```

To perform a single test run:
```
npm test
```

To automatically run tests as files within the js directory are edited:
```
npm run tdd
```
